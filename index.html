<p> Helllllooooo i'm abrar a female, a computer engineer from Jordan. studied at Albalqa university.started on 2016 and graduated on 2021. interested in programming, like how we can use code to make something, how to create a new program which is useful for some people, and how to make a machine work. Also, how to solve some problems using it. 

    i have a Java course from beprogramming company. and now I am in scholarship with ASAC.
    
   i take my major just like a gate (or we can say it is a general field) to know what branch i preferred (network, hardware, programming, communication, etc).
    in the end i discovered i prefer programming after taking C++ course in the university and failed in midterm exam. after thinking seriously about dropping it or not, i made an extra effort to pass it, and pass it ^^. 
    
    i like to do my job at evening cause i like quiet moments and places.

    <br/>
    <b> My goal</b> submit a job, if not work as a freelancer, if not learn more about programming.
